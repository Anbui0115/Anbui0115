### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is An, welcome to my Github !


### About me ðŸŒ±

All my life I have been observant on how to make the world around me simpler or more productive. Software engineering gave me the vehicle to leverage my skills and contribute on a global scale. 
As a full stack software developer, I have enjoyed using JavaScript, Python, React/Redux, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express, Python, CSS, and HTML in my projects. 

When I'm not at my desk, I enjoy taking dance classes, camping, baking and exploring nature. I take pleasure in reading and I always find time to learn and grow as a person.
